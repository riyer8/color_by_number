# Color by Number

_Inspired by my new found summer hobby (I just wish I was coloring with color pencils instead of an Apple Pencil)._

Below is the first iteration of my color by number

![Comparison of the color by numbers](images_generated/color_by_number_iter1.png "Side by side comparison of the color by number with original image, black and white image, and colored image, and color palette")

Note that there is a lot of distortion between the original image to the new image. Currently trying to fix it âœ¨

Note for future works:

- Editing image processing to avoid generating all the smaller regions and black dot distortions
- Interactive component of a real color-by-number image.
